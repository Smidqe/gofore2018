This is a very simplistic eRecipe (not for medicine but for delicious cookings) program. Documentation is made with Sphix and can be found in build/html/ folder

Required 3rd party packages (package config not yet present):

    - flask
    - requests

Steps to get it working (in linux):

    1. export $FLASK_APP='server.py' in terminal when in the program directory
    2. flask run
    3. Program is now running in port 5000 locally
    (4.) Run request.py in tests/ to test out the functionality


Made in Python 3.6.4
